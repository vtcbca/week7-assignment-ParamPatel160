Program 2: Read Python.txt file and Print total number of lines and words in it.
import csv
with open("c:/sqlite3/csv/Python.txt","r",errors="ignore") as f:
    content = f.read()
    total_lines = content.count('\n') + 1
    words = content.split()
    total_words = len(words)
    print(content)
   
Python is a popular general-purpose programming language.
It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used in machine learning, web development, desktop applications, and many other fields. 
Fortunately for beginners, Python has a simple, easy-to-use syntax. 
This makes Python a great language to learn for beginners.
Why Learn Python?
Python is easy to learn. Its syntax is easy and code is very readable.
Python has a lot of applications. It's used for developing web applications, data science, rapid application development, and so on.
Python allows you to write programs in fewer lines of code than most of the programming languages.
The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. Now it's one of the most popular programming languages.\

print("Total number of lines:", total_lines)
print("Total number of words:", total_words)

PROGRAM-2 OUTPUT:-
Total number of lines: 10
Total number of words: 121

Program 3: Read Python.txt file and Print unique word with its count.
import csv
with open('c:\\sqlite3\\CSV\\python.txt','r') as rf:
    file=rf.read()
    print(file)
    words=file.split()
    u=set(words)
    print("Unique Values Are:",u)
    for word in u:
        print(word, ":", words.count(word))


Program 4: Read Python.txt file and Print largest and smallest word from it.
import csv
with open("c:/sqlite3/csv/Python.txt","r",errors="ignore") as f:
    content = f.read()
    words = content.split()
    cleaned_words = [word.strip('.,!?').lower() for word in words]
    largest_word = max(cleaned_words, key=len)
    smallest_word = min(cleaned_words, key=len)
    print(f"Largest word: {largest_word}")
    print(f"Smallest word: {smallest_word}")

PROGRAM-4 OUTPUT:-
Largest word: general-purpose
Smallest word: a

Program 5: Read Python.txt file. Convert it into upper case and write into another file "Python_Upper.txt"
import csv
with open("c:/sqlite3/csv/Python.txt","r",errors="ignore") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
    with open("c:/sqlite3/csv/Python_Upper.txt","w") as f1:
        f1.write(content.upper())
